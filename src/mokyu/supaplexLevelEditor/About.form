By contrast,&lt;br&gt; the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&lt;br&gt; share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&lt;br&gt; software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&lt;br&gt; GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&lt;br&gt; any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&lt;br&gt; your programs, too.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&lt;br&gt; price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&lt;br&gt; have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&lt;br&gt; them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&lt;br&gt; want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&lt;br&gt; free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&lt;br&gt; these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&lt;br&gt; certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&lt;br&gt; you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&lt;br&gt; gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&lt;br&gt; freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&lt;br&gt; or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&lt;br&gt; know their rights.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&lt;br&gt; (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&lt;br&gt; giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains&lt;br&gt; that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&apos; and&lt;br&gt; authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&lt;br&gt; changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&lt;br&gt; authors of previous versions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&lt;br&gt; modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&lt;br&gt; can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&lt;br&gt; protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software.  The systematic&lt;br&gt; pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&lt;br&gt; use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&lt;br&gt; have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&lt;br&gt; products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&lt;br&gt; stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&lt;br&gt; of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&lt;br&gt; States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&lt;br&gt; software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&lt;br&gt; avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&lt;br&gt; make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&lt;br&gt; patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&lt;br&gt; modification follow.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   0. Definitions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&lt;br&gt; works, such as semiconductor masks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&lt;br&gt; License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&lt;br&gt; &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&lt;br&gt; in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&lt;br&gt; exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&lt;br&gt; earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&lt;br&gt; on the Program.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&lt;br&gt; permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&lt;br&gt; infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&lt;br&gt; computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&lt;br&gt; distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&lt;br&gt; public, and in some countries other activities as well.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&lt;br&gt; parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&lt;br&gt; a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&lt;br&gt; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&lt;br&gt; feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&lt;br&gt; tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&lt;br&gt; extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&lt;br&gt; work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&lt;br&gt; the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&lt;br&gt; menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   1. Source Code.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&lt;br&gt; for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&lt;br&gt; form of a work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&lt;br&gt; standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&lt;br&gt; interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&lt;br&gt; is widely used among developers working in that language.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&lt;br&gt; than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&lt;br&gt; packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&lt;br&gt; Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&lt;br&gt; Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&lt;br&gt; implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&lt;br&gt; &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&lt;br&gt; (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&lt;br&gt; (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&lt;br&gt; produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&lt;br&gt; the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&lt;br&gt; work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&lt;br&gt; control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s&lt;br&gt; System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&lt;br&gt; programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&lt;br&gt; which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&lt;br&gt; includes interface definition files associated with source files for&lt;br&gt; the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&lt;br&gt; linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&lt;br&gt; such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&lt;br&gt; subprograms and other parts of the work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&lt;br&gt; can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&lt;br&gt; Source.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&lt;br&gt; same work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   2. Basic Permissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&lt;br&gt; copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&lt;br&gt; conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&lt;br&gt; permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&lt;br&gt; covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&lt;br&gt; content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&lt;br&gt; rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&lt;br&gt; convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&lt;br&gt; in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&lt;br&gt; of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&lt;br&gt; with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&lt;br&gt; the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&lt;br&gt; not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&lt;br&gt; for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&lt;br&gt; and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&lt;br&gt; your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&lt;br&gt; the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&lt;br&gt; makes it unnecessary.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&lt;br&gt; measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&lt;br&gt; 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&lt;br&gt; similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&lt;br&gt; measures.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&lt;br&gt; circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&lt;br&gt; is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&lt;br&gt; the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&lt;br&gt; modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s&lt;br&gt; users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of&lt;br&gt; technological measures.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you&lt;br&gt; receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&lt;br&gt; appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&lt;br&gt; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&lt;br&gt; non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&lt;br&gt; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&lt;br&gt; recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&lt;br&gt; and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&lt;br&gt; produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&lt;br&gt; terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&lt;br&gt;     it, and giving a relevant date.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&lt;br&gt;     released under this License and any conditions added under section&lt;br&gt;     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&lt;br&gt;     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&lt;br&gt;     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&lt;br&gt;     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&lt;br&gt;     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&lt;br&gt;     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&lt;br&gt;     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&lt;br&gt;     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&lt;br&gt;     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&lt;br&gt;     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&lt;br&gt;     work need not make them do so.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&lt;br&gt; works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&lt;br&gt; and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&lt;br&gt; in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&lt;br&gt; &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&lt;br&gt; used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users&lt;br&gt; beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&lt;br&gt; in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&lt;br&gt; parts of the aggregate.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&lt;br&gt; of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&lt;br&gt; machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&lt;br&gt; in one of these ways:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&lt;br&gt;     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&lt;br&gt;     customarily used for software interchange.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&lt;br&gt;     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&lt;br&gt;     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&lt;br&gt;     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&lt;br&gt;     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&lt;br&gt;     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&lt;br&gt;     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&lt;br&gt;     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&lt;br&gt;     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&lt;br&gt;     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&lt;br&gt;     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&lt;br&gt;     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&lt;br&gt;     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&lt;br&gt;     with subsection 6b.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&lt;br&gt;     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&lt;br&gt;     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&lt;br&gt;     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&lt;br&gt;     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&lt;br&gt;     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&lt;br&gt;     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&lt;br&gt;     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&lt;br&gt;     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&lt;br&gt;     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&lt;br&gt;     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&lt;br&gt;     charge under subsection 6d.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&lt;br&gt; from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&lt;br&gt; included in conveying the object code work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&lt;br&gt; tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&lt;br&gt; or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&lt;br&gt; into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&lt;br&gt; doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&lt;br&gt; product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&lt;br&gt; typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&lt;br&gt; of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&lt;br&gt; actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&lt;br&gt; is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&lt;br&gt; commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&lt;br&gt; the only significant mode of use of the product.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&lt;br&gt; procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&lt;br&gt; and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&lt;br&gt; a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&lt;br&gt; suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&lt;br&gt; code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&lt;br&gt; modification has been made.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&lt;br&gt; specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&lt;br&gt; part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&lt;br&gt; User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&lt;br&gt; fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&lt;br&gt; Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&lt;br&gt; by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&lt;br&gt; if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&lt;br&gt; modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&lt;br&gt; been installed in ROM).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&lt;br&gt; requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&lt;br&gt; for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&lt;br&gt; the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&lt;br&gt; network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&lt;br&gt; adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&lt;br&gt; protocols for communication across the network.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&lt;br&gt; in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&lt;br&gt; documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&lt;br&gt; source code form), and must require no special password or key for&lt;br&gt; unpacking, reading or copying.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   7. Additional Terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&lt;br&gt; License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&lt;br&gt; Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&lt;br&gt; be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&lt;br&gt; that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&lt;br&gt; apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&lt;br&gt; under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&lt;br&gt; this License without regard to the additional permissions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&lt;br&gt; remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&lt;br&gt; it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&lt;br&gt; removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&lt;br&gt; additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&lt;br&gt; for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&lt;br&gt; add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&lt;br&gt; that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&lt;br&gt;     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&lt;br&gt;     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&lt;br&gt;     Notices displayed by works containing it; or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&lt;br&gt;     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&lt;br&gt;     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&lt;br&gt;     authors of the material; or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&lt;br&gt;     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&lt;br&gt;     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&lt;br&gt;     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&lt;br&gt;     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&lt;br&gt;     those licensors and authors.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&lt;br&gt; restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&lt;br&gt; received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&lt;br&gt; governed by this License along with a term that is a further&lt;br&gt; restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&lt;br&gt; a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&lt;br&gt; License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&lt;br&gt; of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&lt;br&gt; not survive such relicensing or conveying.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&lt;br&gt; must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&lt;br&gt; additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&lt;br&gt; where to find the applicable terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&lt;br&gt; form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&lt;br&gt; the above requirements apply either way.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   8. Termination.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&lt;br&gt; provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&lt;br&gt; modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&lt;br&gt; this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&lt;br&gt; paragraph of section 11).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&lt;br&gt; license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&lt;br&gt; provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&lt;br&gt; finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&lt;br&gt; holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&lt;br&gt; prior to 60 days after the cessation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&lt;br&gt; reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&lt;br&gt; violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&lt;br&gt; received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&lt;br&gt; copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&lt;br&gt; your receipt of the notice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&lt;br&gt; licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&lt;br&gt; this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&lt;br&gt; reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&lt;br&gt; material under section 10.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&lt;br&gt; run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&lt;br&gt; occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&lt;br&gt; to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&lt;br&gt; nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&lt;br&gt; modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&lt;br&gt; not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&lt;br&gt; covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&lt;br&gt; receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&lt;br&gt; propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&lt;br&gt; for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&lt;br&gt; organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&lt;br&gt; organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&lt;br&gt; work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&lt;br&gt; transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&lt;br&gt; licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could&lt;br&gt; give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&lt;br&gt; Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&lt;br&gt; the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&lt;br&gt; rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&lt;br&gt; not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&lt;br&gt; rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&lt;br&gt; (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&lt;br&gt; any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&lt;br&gt; sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   11. Patents.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&lt;br&gt; License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&lt;br&gt; work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&lt;br&gt; owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&lt;br&gt; hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&lt;br&gt; by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&lt;br&gt; but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&lt;br&gt; consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&lt;br&gt; purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&lt;br&gt; patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&lt;br&gt; this License.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&lt;br&gt; patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to&lt;br&gt; make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&lt;br&gt; propagate the contents of its contributor version.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&lt;br&gt; agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&lt;br&gt; (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&lt;br&gt; sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&lt;br&gt; party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&lt;br&gt; patent against the party.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&lt;br&gt; and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&lt;br&gt; to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&lt;br&gt; publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&lt;br&gt; then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&lt;br&gt; available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&lt;br&gt; patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&lt;br&gt; consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&lt;br&gt; license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&lt;br&gt; actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&lt;br&gt; covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work&lt;br&gt; in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&lt;br&gt; country that you have reason to believe are valid.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&lt;br&gt; arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&lt;br&gt; covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&lt;br&gt; receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&lt;br&gt; or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&lt;br&gt; you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&lt;br&gt; work and works based on it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&lt;br&gt; the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&lt;br&gt; conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&lt;br&gt; specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&lt;br&gt; work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&lt;br&gt; in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&lt;br&gt; to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&lt;br&gt; the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&lt;br&gt; parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&lt;br&gt; patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&lt;br&gt; conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&lt;br&gt; for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&lt;br&gt; contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&lt;br&gt; or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&lt;br&gt; any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&lt;br&gt; otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&lt;br&gt; otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&lt;br&gt; excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&lt;br&gt; covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&lt;br&gt; License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&lt;br&gt; not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&lt;br&gt; to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&lt;br&gt; the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&lt;br&gt; License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&lt;br&gt; permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&lt;br&gt; under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&lt;br&gt; combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&lt;br&gt; License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&lt;br&gt; but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&lt;br&gt; section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&lt;br&gt; combination as such.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   14. Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&lt;br&gt; the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&lt;br&gt; be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&lt;br&gt; address new problems or concerns.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&lt;br&gt; Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&lt;br&gt; Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&lt;br&gt; option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&lt;br&gt; version or of any later version published by the Free Software&lt;br&gt; Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&lt;br&gt; GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&lt;br&gt; by the Free Software Foundation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&lt;br&gt; versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s&lt;br&gt; public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&lt;br&gt; to choose that version for the Program.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   Later license versions may give you additional or different&lt;br&gt; permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&lt;br&gt; author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&lt;br&gt; later version.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&lt;br&gt; APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&lt;br&gt; HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&lt;br&gt; OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&lt;br&gt; THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&lt;br&gt; PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&lt;br&gt; IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&lt;br&gt; ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   16. Limitation of Liability.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&lt;br&gt; WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&lt;br&gt; THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&lt;br&gt; GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&lt;br&gt; USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&lt;br&gt; DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&lt;br&gt; PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&lt;br&gt; EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&lt;br&gt; SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&lt;br&gt; above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&lt;br&gt; reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&lt;br&gt; an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&lt;br&gt; Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&lt;br&gt; copy of the Program in return for a fee.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&lt;br&gt; possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&lt;br&gt; free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&lt;br&gt; to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&lt;br&gt; state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&lt;br&gt; the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     &lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&lt;br&gt;     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&lt;br&gt;     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&lt;br&gt;     (at your option) any later version.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&lt;br&gt;     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&lt;br&gt;     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
